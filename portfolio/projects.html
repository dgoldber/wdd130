                    <h2>Zion Choir</h2>
                    <p>I am an alumnus of Zion Choir, a religious high-school-age choir. A few years ago, I was asked to take over the website. The site had been taken down by malicious hackers, and the previous web master did not have time to fix it, or to continue taking care of it. I was asked to rebuild it in time for upcomming auditions.</p>
                    <p>I was able to restore the content by using the web archive. I probably could have restored the design, but I redid it in WordPress for 3 reasons: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The old design was outdated.</li>
                        <li>We wanted the site up in time for auditions. If I used wordpress, I could customize a premade design rather than taking time to copy the old design.</li>
                        <li>Using wordpress also allowed the Directors to access the site and make content changes without needing me.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Hangman in Elm</h2>
                    <p>This is a small program I wrote for my dad (who is also a programmer) for Father's Day. I did this partially as an experiment while I was learning Elm, and partially to show him, as he was only familiar with functional programming languages in concept.</p>
