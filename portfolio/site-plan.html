        Welcome to my portfolio! If you're looking to know more about me and my coding abilities, you've come to the right place. 
      </p>
      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>I was born and raised in the heart of Silicon Valley, only a few miles away from Ebay HQ. I've been doing front and backend web development professionally since 2015.
      </p>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading Science-Fiction and Fantasy, playing PvE or story driven games, and bicycling. I don't like writing filler, but will if a class assignment requires me to.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        The only project I have publically available at the moment is the <a href="https://zionchoir.org/">Zion Choir website</a>. I am a Zion Choir alumnus from when I was in highschool, and run the website for a family member who is one of the current directors. I was asked to take over the site due to the site being taken down by malicious hackers, and because the previous webmaster did not have time to take care of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In restoring the site, I also redid the design to give it a more modern look. The website is powered by Wordpress, as it gives user-friendly tools to the directors so that they can make changes by themselves without needing to go through me, and because Wordpress allowed me to use prebuilt themes, which was important while trying to restore a dead website without backups in time for upcoming auditions.
      </p>
